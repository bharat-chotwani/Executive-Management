## About Company
 + Atliq Hardwares is a leading computer hardware manufacturer in India. The company has successfully expanded into international markets.
 + The management lacks timely and actionable insights to make quick, data-driven decisions. There is a need for a stronger data analytics foundation within the organization.

 + Tony Sharma, the Director of Data Analytics, is leading the hiring process. He is looking for candidates with a balance of technical (especially SQL) and soft skills. To assess these skills, he has initiated a SQL challenge as part of the hiring process.
